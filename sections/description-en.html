It formally represents (1) the classification and provenance information of indicators in the GRI and ESRS standards; (2) the requirements for indicators. RSO is envisioned to be integrated into the SME digital infrastructure. Accompanied by suitable digital infrastructure, the reporting system leveraging RSO as a knowledge base will empower the daily tasks of sustainability managers.
