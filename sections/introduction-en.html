This ontology is designed to enhance the interoperability of sustainability reporting standards for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). It achieves this by mapping indicators across various standards to identify both overlapping and distinct reporting requirements. This mapping facilitates the reuse of report data and clarifies unique compliance needs, significantly reducing redundancy and effort for SMEs. The ontology leverages existing vocabularies such as the Organization Ontology and QUDT to ensure robustness and adherence to established semantic frameworks.
